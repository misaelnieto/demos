# My collection of HTML/CSS/JS demos

This the repo of a site that is a collection of some HTML/CSS/JS demos or toys
I wrote.

If you are not me, you might just go to https://demos.noenieto.com instead.

If you are me then `cd` to the folder, install the needed dependencies and run
`npm start` to run the sass compiler.

```bash
cd demos.noenieto.com
npm install
bower install
npm start
```

Finally commit the changes and deploy.

P.S. If you are curious, I initially generated the site with the help of the
[foundation commandline](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download.html/).
